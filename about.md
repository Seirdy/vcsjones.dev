I've always had a passion for the strange, interesting, and extraordinary.
I'm currently a Security Lead at Upside in Washington DC, and focus
on keeping web applications secure and helping others adopt best practices.

I'm also a dedicated community member and ASP.NET MVP. Frequently speaking
at code camps and user groups, he loves to share what he knows and especially
learning from others.
