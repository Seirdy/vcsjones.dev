Eventually I’ll blog about them in detail, but I’ve made a few changes to my
site.

First, I turned on support for HTTP/2. Secondly, I added support for the
`CHACHA20_POLY1305` cipher suite. Third, if your browser supports it, images
will be served in the WebP format. Currently the only browser that does is
Chrome.

My blog tends to be a vetting process for adopting things. If all of these
things go well, then I can start recommending them in non-trivial projects.
