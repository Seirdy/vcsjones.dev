For the past eight and a half years, I've enjoyed many different challenges at
Thycotic. From working on some tough security implementations to consulting. I'm
always interested in new challenges, seeing what else lies beyond where I am
now. That is why I've accepted employment with Higher Logic. I'll be joining
their team continuing what I do best: solving problems and doing my best to make
customers happy.

I'm looking forward to it.
